# discord-transferdata-bot
A simple Open-Source Discord Bot made for Hacktoberfest!

_Use it to backup from one server to another (if you're an **Admin** of both)._

- Under construction ⚙️
- Accepting contributions! 😊

## Possible Features:
- Own API to store functions (it will be open-source too);
- Backup: Emojis, Channels, Server Info;
- Slash Commands (discord.js v13 and node.js v12 required).

## Notes:
I wanted to do something to Hacktoberfest, and since I use Discord a lot (and found myself wanting to transfer emojis to another server), why not?

Also, this is my first time (September 07) making something with "my" own _super secret API_, so yay!
